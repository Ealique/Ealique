## From Kitchen to Code: My Unexpected Journey ‍➡️

For over 12 years, I whipped up culinary creations in a bustling school kitchen. But deep down, I yearned for a different kind of recipe – one that involved data, insights, and the power to transform information into actionable knowledge. That's why I embarked on an intensive data analytics bootcamp, and let me tell you, it's been a wild and wonderful ride!

## My Arsenal of Skills ️

* **Databases**: MySQL, Workbench (Where data comes to life!) ️
* **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI (Turning numbers into stories!) 
* **ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load (The data pipeline master!) ⚙️
* **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from the digital wild! ️
* **Python Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas (Data wrangling ninjas!) 
* **Methodologies**: Agile (Adapting and thriving in dynamic environments!) 
* **Communication**: Slack (Teamwork makes the dream work!)
